1. Project Title / Headline

📦 Inventory & Supply Chain Dashboard: Real-Time Insights on Warehouse Utilization, Inventory Health, and Logistics Costs
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to track supply chain performance, warehouse capacity, and inventory movements across categories and regions—helping operations leaders improve efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize fulfillment.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The Inventory & Supply Chain Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of warehouse utilization, inventory turnover, transportation costs, and backorder status. It enables supply chain managers, operations analysts, and executives to monitor trends, identify bottlenecks, and improve strategic decision-making in capacity planning, logistics, and demand fulfillment.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform for building and publishing the dashboard

🔄 Power Query (M) – Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation from raw inventory and logistics data

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures for warehouse utilization %, turnover ratio, and days of inventory

🧩 Data Modeling – Relationships structured between warehouse, category, region, and time dimensions

🗄 SQL Database / ERP System – Source of transactional data including inventory, orders, and shipments

📁 File Format – .pbix (Power BI project) with exportable visuals for reporting and presentation

4. Data Source

Source: Inventory and Supply Chain dataset (multi-year, across categories and regions).
The dataset includes:

Inventory levels by product category (Clothing, Electronics, Furniture, Accessories)

Warehouse capacity utilization %

Transportation costs by region (North, West, East, South)

Inventory turnover ratio and days sales of inventory

Lead time by product category

Backorders by status (Fulfilled, Pending, Canceled)

Units sold by year (2020–2024)

5. Features / Highlights

• Business Problem
Organizations face challenges in balancing inventory efficiency, transportation costs, and customer fulfillment. Overstocking increases holding costs while understocking leads to lost sales and backorders. Leaders require visibility into utilization, costs, and performance across categories and regions.

• Goal of the Dashboard
To empower supply chain and operations teams with:

Real-time visibility of warehouse utilization and inventory health

Insights into logistics cost distribution by region

Monitoring of order fulfillment and backorder risks

Category-level tracking for inventory planning and replenishment

Multi-year sales and demand analysis
